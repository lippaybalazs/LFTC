the scanner separates the file into lines and the lines into words
using the separate function which preserves separators (ignores spaces)
and ignores separators inside "quotation mark pairs"

each word is checked if it is a reserved word, than if it matches the identifier pattern
and lastly if it matches constant patterns. In case no match was found we print it as a
lexical error and terminate the process

pif is a simple list, identifiers and constants stored separately in binary trees

it has 3 regex patterns:

identifier: ^[a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-z0-9]*$
    first character is a letter, rest can be numbers as well

integer: ^[1-9][0-9]+$|^[0-9]$
    first character is between 1 and 9, rest can be 0 through 9,
    also allows a single character between 0 and 9

string: ^\".*\"$
    checks if the text is inside quotation marks
